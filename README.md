# Hedie-s-Crypto-Token
Using Solidity, I programmed my own cryptocurrency called “HediesToken”. 
Solidity is an OOP language based on JavaScript which was used to deploy 10,000 tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. 
To support client requests such as transfer of tokens or balance checking, a mapping data structure is used with inner and outer keys.
